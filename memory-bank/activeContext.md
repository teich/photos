# Active Context

## Current Focus

### Project Phase: Media Storage Optimization
We are optimizing the media storage and processing pipeline. Recent changes and plans include:

1. **Media Storage Strategy**
   - Maintain current section-based organization
   - Use Next/Image for image optimization on Vercel
   - Leverage Vercel Blob for video storage
   - Keep thumbnails and previews in git

2. **Processing Pipeline**
   - Keep existing thumbnail generation
   - Maintain video preview creation
   - Add Blob upload during deployment
   - Preserve metadata structure

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Simple file dropping in sections
   - Local processing with npm scripts
   - Automated Vercel deployment
   - Transparent video handling

## Recent Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Routing Structure**
   - Simple /[id] route for images
   - Removed parallel routes
   - Standard page transitions
   - Browser history integration

2. **Data Management**
   - Server actions for file access
   - Runtime metadata loading
   - No client-side caching
   - Built-in Next.js caching

3. **Component Organization**
   - Simplified component hierarchy
   - Clear client/server boundaries
   - Reduced prop drilling
   - Minimal state management

## Active Considerations
